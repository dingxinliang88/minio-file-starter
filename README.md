## Features

- Upload files: The `uploadFile` method allows you to upload a file to the Minio server. You can specify a prefix, file name, input stream of the file, and file type. It returns the full path of the uploaded file.
- Upload image files: The `uploadImage` method is a convenience method specifically designed for uploading image files. It takes similar parameters as the `uploadFile` method but does not require specifying the file type explicitly.
- Upload HTML files: The `uploadHtml` method is another convenient method for uploading HTML files. Like the `uploadImage` method, it simplifies the process by not requiring the explicit specification of the file type.
- Delete files: The `delete` method allows you to delete a file from the Minio server. You need to provide the full path of the file to be deleted.
- Download files: The `downloadFile` method enables you to download a file from the Minio server. You provide the full path of the file, and it returns an input stream containing the file data.
